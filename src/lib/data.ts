Risk Assessment Report: Siberian Tundra
Date: 2024-07-29
Authors: Dr. Anya Sharma, Dr. Ben Carter

Executive Summary:
This report details findings from recent satellite and ground-based monitoring of the Siberian Tundra. Analysis of P-band and L-band SAR data from UAVSAR missions reveals accelerated subsurface thawing in the Yamal Peninsula. Ground temperatures have risen by an average of 1.5Â°C over the past decade, exceeding global averages.

Key Findings:
1.  Thaw Subsidence: Significant land subsidence has been detected, with some areas dropping by up to 2 meters. This poses a direct threat to infrastructure, including pipelines and local community buildings in Sabetta.
2.  Methane Emissions: TROPOMI satellite data indicates a sharp increase in methane concentrations, correlating with the identified thaw zones. We estimate a 30% increase in methane release from this region compared to the 2010-2020 baseline.
3.  Hydrological Changes: The formation of new thermokarst lakes is widespread. These lakes alter local ecosystems and further accelerate permafrost thaw beneath them.

Impact on Arctic Communities:
The community of Sabetta is at high risk. Foundational instability of buildings is a primary concern. Changes in caribou migration patterns, linked to landscape alterations, are impacting traditional hunting practices. Water source quality may also be affected by sediment release from thawing ground.

Recommendations:
- Immediate reinforcement of critical infrastructure in Sabetta.
- Continuous, high-resolution monitoring of methane levels.
- Community engagement to develop adaptation strategies for food and water security.
